## Project Description

The "Smart Home Safety System" is an advanced Internet of Things (IoT) project 
designed to enhance domestic safety by leveraging real-time environmental 
monitoring. This system integrates a network of sensors, actuators, and 
microcontrollers to detect and respond to potential hazards such as high temperatures 
and gas leaks. Utilizing two ESP8266 microcontrollers, the system divides 
responsibilities: one acts as a client, interfacing with sensors (DHT11 for temperature 
and humidity, MQ-9 for gas detection) and actuators (servo motors for window 
control, buzzer for alarms), while the other functions as a server, managing data 
display on an LCD and network communications. The inclusion of LEDs provides 
intuitive visual feedback, indicating safe or hazardous conditions. Remote monitoring 
and control are facilitated through the Blynk mobile and web application, enhancing 
user engagement and system responsiveness.

The project tackles the limitations of traditional home safety systems by providing a 
more interactive and immediate response to environmental dangers. The 
implementation of the project involved careful planning and execution, including 
circuit assembly for both client and server components, programming of the ESP8266 
microcontrollers, and integration with the Blynk platform for enhanced user 
interaction. The report details the project's design, implementation, and 
functionalities, highlighting its potential to transform home safety measures through 
technology.
